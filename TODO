Yet to do:

+ centralize config vars in a global struct
+ add logic to avoid network-mounted volumes
+ try to do UNICODE text?

Done from TODO list:

+ Handle [gb]zipped files
+ Switch to autotools for building
+ figure out distinguishing files from dirs on Solaris (can't use dirent alone!)
+ add more sane selection of path to magic file (not hard coded!)
+ add config file for regexps and paths
+ add multiple output files for more useful auditing / debugging
+ add file extension skip list
+ add more report output (banner, more aggregate stats)
+ add command line argument handling (magic file, feature enable, debug output)
